# 20171220\_AI\_MeetUp\_Presentation

This repository is devoted to cataloguing the presentation, notebboks, and data given at the New York Healthcare Artificial Intelligence Society meeting on 12/20/2017. 


You can view the pdf [here](http://nickg.bio/_posts/20171220_NYHAIS_talk.pdf)

A data file had to be removed because it exceeded the limit, so the Rmarkdown file won't compile. But if you want that data, let me know and I'll share it. 

The jupyter notebook should work-you most likely need to use a python 3 kernel. 

Feel free to email me at nick.giangreco@gmail.com about any issues.
